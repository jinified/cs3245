== General Notes about this assignment ==

Indexing: 
A corpus is first generated by reading files in reuter folder. Stemming and 
case-folding is then performed on each token to produce terms that will be stored
in dictionary together with the associated document frequency. For the posting list, it 
is ordered in descending order of tf-idf using the lnc.ltc scheme. The weight for each
document is precalculated to save computation time in search phase.

Searching:
For each query, it's associated posting list if exists is only retrieved up to K docs to 
save computation time. Score is calculated via cosine similarity between weight of query and 
weight of document.
