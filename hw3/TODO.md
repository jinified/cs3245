## Knowledge

### Weighting
1. Term frequency - sum(1 + log10(tf))
2. Inverse Document Frequency - log10(N/df). N is total number of docs in corpus
3. tf-idf - tf * idf

### Similarity
1. Lenght normalize. Divide by L2 Norm
2. cosine similarity. dot product 

### Weighting scheme 
1. SMART notation - ddd.qqq.
2. Implement lnc.ltc

### Optimizations
1.
