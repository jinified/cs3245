This is the README file for A0112213E's submission

== Personal Information ==
Matric No: A0112213E
Email: a0112213@u.nus.edu

== General Notes about this assignment ==

1. Third-party libraries and services used

lxml		- XML parser for both query and corpus 
whoosh		- full-text indexing and searching library  
terrier 	- open source IR platform with indexing and searching capability
WordNet		- large lexical database for English words
Wikipedia	- extra information about particular patent for query expansion
IPC			- retrieves definition for classes in corpus

2. XML Parsing

 - Uses lxml to parse query and corpus into native dictionary format. Fields without 
any content is set as empty string for ease of computation
 - Use NLTK's XMLCorpusReader 


3. Term Normalization 

 - stemming, case-folding, removing punctuations, removing stopword

4. Document Representation

 - includes every terms 
 - includes `title`, `abstract`, `patent number` 

## Indexing 
## Query processing 
## Searching
## Evaluation

== Strategies by previous students ==

1. Using `title` as query and `title + abstract` as document 
2. Weighted tf-idf giving more weight to terms that appear in `title` or certain `zone`
3. Calculate relevance to IPC groups
4. Run search on google patent api 
5. Stores patent info in extra file 
6. Remove words with low idf 
7. Using wordnet expansion 

== Strategies by journal papers ==
