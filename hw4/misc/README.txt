== General Notes about this assignment ==

1. Third-party libraries and services used

lxml		- XML parser for both query and corpus 
whoosh		- full-text indexing and searching library  
terrier 	- open source IR platform with indexing and searching capability
WordNet		- large lexical database for English words
Wikipedia	- extra information about particular patent for query expansion
IPC			- retrieves definition for classes in corpus

2. XML Parsing

Uses lxml to parse query and corpus into native dictionary format. Fields without 
any content is set as empty string for ease of computation

3. Document Representation
 - includes `title`, `abstract`, `patent number`
