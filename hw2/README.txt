== General Notes about this assignment ==

Indexing: A corpus is first generated by reading files in reuter folder. Stemming and 
case-folding is then performed on each token to produce terms that will be stored
in dictionary together with the associated document frequency. Skip pointers are generated
on-demand during the search phase. The decision to store both files as text instead 
of binary format improves readability and allows us to use line number as pointer to posting list.
